            My name is Spencer Moore, and I am a 6' caucasian man from Idaho Falls Idaho. I am 21 years old, but have had the opportunity to 
            learn a lot, and benifit from a lot of experiences during my short life time. I have developed skills, failed, stood back up, and
            kept on trying until I suceed. I have done hard things, but also have been very blessed during my life time. In this small page, 
            I will attempt to share what I have learned, and a little bit about me!
